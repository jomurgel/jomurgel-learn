At the end of July, I started taking photos again. It was the start of a new approach to my photography having spent a considerable amount of time basically relearning everything I thought I knew about photography.

I spent some time finding a studio and planning down to some of the smallest details. It was, in fact, the first shoot I'd done with a fully-formed image in my head of what I'd like to accomplish. It was also the first shoot in which I could look at the photos, raw, on the back of the camera and visualize the end result.

All in all, I'm pretty happy with how they turned out.

  <img src="/inarguable-3.jpg" alt="woman in orange, near window, looking at the camera" />
  <img src="/inarguable-4.jpg" alt="woman in black bra, in front of a window, looking at the camera over shoulder" />
  <img src="/inarguable-5.jpg" alt="woman on bed looking away from camera" />
  <img src="/inarguable-6.jpg" alt="woman, shrouded by curtain, in black bra looking at camera" />
</div>

Of the photos that I took that day, this one: In·ar·gu·a·ble #1 is my favorite. A perfect representation of the goal I had for the shoot and final product.
