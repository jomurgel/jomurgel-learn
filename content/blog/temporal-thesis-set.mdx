Back in 2007 I shot these for my thesis project. My final act as a college student was to capture these photos on film with analog tech in my bedroom having draped the walls in cheap velvet. It was the first time I shot people and the last time I would take a look photo with a DSLR camera in almost seven years.

  <img src="/temporal-2.jpg" alt="temporal photo 2" />
  <img src="/temporal-3.jpg" alt="temporal photo 3" />
  <img src="/temporal-4.jpg" alt="temporal photo" />
  <img src="/temporal-5.jpg" alt="temporal photo" />
  <img src="/temporal-6.jpg" alt="temporal photo" />
  <img src="/temporal-7.jpg" alt="temporal photo" />
  <img src="/temporal-8.jpg" alt="temporal photo 8" />
  <img src="/temporal-9.jpg" alt="temporal photo 9" />
  <img src="/temporal-10.jpg" alt="temporal photo 10" />
  <img src="/temporal-11.jpg" alt="temporal photo 11" />
  <img src="/temporal-12.jpg" alt="temporal photo 12" />
</div>

Because I had to go through the entire process of shooting, developing, and processing with trial and error I gained my appreciation and love for color. This was also why I tend to title my art with single words. A complex process to end in a simple sussinct description of the feeling felt during creation always feltâ€¦right.
