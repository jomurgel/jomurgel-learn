I was recently presented with an opportunity. My previous employer did a round of layoffs that directly affected me. Job loss is a terrifying thing, probably one of the more disruptive events in adulthood. While my immediate reaction was to panic, I decided to accept things as they were and embrace the change. Perhaps for the first time in my life.

Change has never been a particularly welcome addition to my life. I've been very comfortable in a routine with expected outcomes. I've historically been the type of person who plans every part of their day from the moment they open their eyes in the morning. That also means I've been the type of person to become anxious and stressed when things don't go according to plan.

I'm still beginning this new journey, but I'm resolved to advocate for myself, find the role that allows me the most significant impact, and start determined to improve myself and the people around me. In the future, I'm taking risks. It seems to be my mantra as of late, especially interesting in that I'm not a big sports fan, but you miss 100% of the shots you don't take. There truly is nothing ventured, nothing gained.

I can't speak to why I've suddenly changed perspective. Still, it may just be that this is the first time in years that I've been afforded a little break long enough to sit with my feelings and form my own opinions, my ambitions, or what drives me to create and allows me to feel fulfilled at the end of the day.

I have become a JoySeeker, one invested in their impact on their community, however small, and aware of the external forces intended to keep us down. Tomorrow is a new day.
