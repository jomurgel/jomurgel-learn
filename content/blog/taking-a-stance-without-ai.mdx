Maybe instead of just using the ChatCPTs and the Clauds and the Geminis of the world just because they exist, we think about using AI more thoughtfully, if at all.

I refuse to interact with AI as far as art or culture are concerned. I agree with the general sentimate that art generated with AI is, at best theft, and at worst, as Hayao Miyazaki said recently, *"an insult to life itself"*.

All I'm saying is, have a goal, think critically, and understand how you individually or as a company impact others when using AI.
