A little while back I started a series I called, rather obviously, Flower. I didn't have an endgame in mind or a real purpose for where this would ultimately end up. It was really a vehicle for working with my equipment or software and understanding myself as a photographer, and get a better idea of my personal voice and personal style.

Cards on the table, I've never been completely comfortable with myself in the role of “photographer”. I've had more that a decade of fairly consistent web and app development, enough to be comfortable in those shoes. Photography, on the other hand, I've been doing on and off for longer, but only consistently for the last several years. My eye, my imagination, and any final product I come up with are so completely disjointed because I just haven't found my glove yet. But that's fine. It's all part of the learning process.

<div data-gallery data-align="wide">
  <img src="/photo-2.jpg" alt="Flower Series 21" />
  <img src="/photo-3.jpg" alt="Flower Series 57" />
  <img src="/photo-4.jpg" alt="Flower Series 04" />
  <img src="/photo-5.jpg" alt="Flower Series 35" />
  <img src="/photo-6.jpg" alt="Flower Series 99" />
  <img src="/photo-7.jpg" alt="Flower Series 28" />
</div>

Against my better judgement, and at the behest of friends and family, I'm sharing a selection of the series to date, if for more other reason than to get it out there. I'll continue to add to my site as I return, full time, to this creative pursuit.

<div data-gallery data-align="wide">
  <img src="/photo-8.jpg" alt="Flower Series 02" />
  <img src="/photo-9.jpg" alt="Flower Series 60" />
  <img src="/photo-10.jpg" alt="Flower Series 74" />
  <img src="/photo-11.jpg" alt="Flower Series 61" />
  <img src="/photo-12.jpg" alt="Flower Series 86" />
  <img src="/photo-13.jpg" alt="Flower Series 62" />
</div>
