The job market is rough out there. Companies aren't hiring right now with all the uncertainty of the American economy. The ones that are might be leveraging AI tools to filter resumes immediatly putting most applicants at a disadvantage. Many companies are seeing an influx of bot applicants making finding the "right person" evermore difficult these days.

For those of you in a stable position within a stable company, keep informed about the state of the industries, job market, think about returning to person-to-person networking and forming real relationships to find your next position.

As I, or you, dear reader, progress toward our next phase, it's important to remember that everything will work out exactly as it should. Maybe not how we want it to or wish it to, but precisely as it's supposed to, and we'll grow and learn as we go, making us all the more prepared.
