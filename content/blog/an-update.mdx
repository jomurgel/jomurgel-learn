I have put an emphasis on retaining the energy I have and being more purposeful with the energy I spend. I got that focus from a few places, not the least of which was this clip circulating the socials.

I have been enjoying life, spending time with friends on and offline, playing games I find engaging, producing more art (albiet at a slow pace), taking on some home rennovation tasks (more on that to come), and putting an emphasis on my family: fur babies, and partner.

I had spent nearly half of my life spending all of my energy on the companies I work for leaving very little left after hours. Now, I'm chosing my areas of focus. I'm chosing to spend my time and energy, like a currency, wisely. I'm looking, now, for a return on investment. I don't plan to change that outlook and methodology when looking for my next career move.

In looking for the next career move, if I decide to approach a company, I'm interviewing them perhaps more deeply than I'm being interviewed. Often little things, good or bad, can give you great insight into how a company works, how they think about the work that they do, and what they value most. More importantly, how they use their energy and expect others to user theirs.

Whatever the next move, I'll be contributing to a good cause, working to improve myself and the people around me, and most importantly, spending my energy wisely. My professional pivot was to a personal focus. That shouldn't change or lose priority just because I've moved back into a Monday-through-Friday job in the future.
