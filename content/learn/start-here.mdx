In an effort to document and catalogue the practical knowledge I've gained over the years, I've decided to gather those modules here. Those modules are broken up into several types: development and photography, for now. They can be consumed in any order, but are catalogued in the order from top to bottom that might make the most sense for a beginner.

I've worked professional as an engineer/developer for more than eighteen years, and been shooting photos for longer, though not professionally. In either case, I've learned a lot of tips, tricks, lessons, and things to avoid in that nearly two decades that might be helpful for future engineers or photographers.

There is a [Creative Support Discord Server](https://discord.gg/wQWUnKntpn) which will be a resource to anyone that finds these useful, would like to suggest edits, additional content, or generally make conversation of the contents of these modules.

Good luck!
