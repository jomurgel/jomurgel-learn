Rolling Stone was one of several PMC-owned and operated brands. I was in charge of the migration and re-architecture of the WordPress CMS updates to use the Block Editor. You can read more about them in that blog post: [PMC Gutenberg](/blog/pmc-gutenberg/).

In addition to being responsible for frontend maintenance and legacy support when a new design system was implemented, and the Gutenberg Block Editor migration, I was responsible for improving the SEO visability of all of the music applications built with React which resulted in a 400% increase in site traffice nearly overnight.

This effort afforded a server-side-rendered approach without needing to re-architect the existing apps.
