Bassmaster was a full website redesign and re-architecture building out a combination of custom Enteprise WordPress features and a component-style set of PHP and React elements for displaying real-time data for tournaments and events.

I led this redesign and built out all of the React-based real-time components including real-time tournament stats, countdown timers, and other API-based components in conjunction with WordPress PHP elements.

In some cases replace what would otherwise be a standard server-side-based element like headers, footers, or interstitial design elements.
