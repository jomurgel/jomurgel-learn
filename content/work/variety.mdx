Variety was one of several PMC-owned and operated brands. I was in charge of the migration and re-architecture of the WordPress CMS updates to use the Block Editor. You can read more about them in that blog post: [PMC Gutenberg](/blog/pmc-gutenberg/).

I was also responsible for frontend maintenance and legacy support when a new design system was implemented. One of many PMC brands I was responsible for in this same capacity.
