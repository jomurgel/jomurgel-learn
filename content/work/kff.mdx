KFF, formerly the Kaiser Family Foundation, is an Enterprise WordPress site built using the Block Editor and utilizes many custom blocks, features, and several custom APIs to return data that I architected.

Blocks were built with flexibility in mind offering single blocks with multiple variations or customizable options. Other blocks were built to serve up React applications which returned custom filterable post and custom post-type content.
