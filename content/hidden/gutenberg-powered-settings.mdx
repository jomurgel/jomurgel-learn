Here's something that bothers me a bit about WordPress right now. We have the beautiful and functional
"Block Editor", but we've not yet gotten to the point where we start to see similar improvements to other
aspects of the site. The Dashboard, Settings Pages, and other non-post-type admin pages still use the same
style from the pre-Gutenberg days.

For those that might not already be aware, in 2019, WordPress rolled the "new" Gutenberg editor into
Core WordPress 5.0. This replaced the TinyMCE and standard HTML inputs with a more dynamic user interface
and leaned more heavily on a client-side interaction with REST endpoints running adjacent to React.js.
Since that initial release, there have been many accessibility, usability, and feature improvements, but
we're still a ways off from a full app-driven interface...and I can't wait.

In this tutorial we're going to build a standard WordPress Settings page that uses the REST API and Core
Gutenberg/Block Editor features to provide a more modern feel.

We're going to be working with some standard PHP features, standard Block Editor features, and then some
custom React features to make this all come together. At the end of this we'll have a plugin that creates
a new Settings Page running client side saving options values without refresh. A link to the final product
is at the bottom of the page.

## Step 1: Setting up the Plugin
I'm going to run through this part pretty quickly, though we'll need a few JS features we'll come
back to later.

## Step 2: Registering the Settings Page
We're going to use standard WordPress filters to register our new settings page. We'll call it "Site Options".

## Step 3: Setup Our JavaScript Build Process
We'll be writing some client-side JS, so we'll also need to setup our plugin to support a build process
so we can turn our React into Vanilla JavaScript; a format the browser will understand.

## Step 4: Creating our React App

## Step 5: Adding our First Setting

## Step 6: Saving the new Settings

## Step 7: All the Rest, and Where Do We Go From Here?
By this point we have registered a new WordPress settings page in a new plugin, added single new
React-powered settings page with a single settings toggle which is saving to our database. Where do
we go from here? Add section headings, new fields, and build out to your heart's content. Eventually
WordPress will replace the Classic backend with a new Block Editor-styled interface, but for now this
makes me feel a little better about adding new features to WordPress. Is it necessary? No. This really is
more of an experiement in testing the boundaries of what WordPress is now capable of, and a lot of the
refreshless saving of options can be done with Ajax, but with a simple and robust set of tools at our
fingertips via the Block Editor, why not use them?
