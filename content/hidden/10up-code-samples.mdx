  <summary>A Quick Note Before We Start:</summary>

  Except for T◩DY, which I built over the last couple of days, and my website, which
  is a few weeks old; the rest has been compiled over the previous five or so years of work, which
  inherently means that some functionality or dependencies which were likely proprietary have been
  removed or lost and may prevent features from functioning. I've added notes throughout if
  there's a caveat to the code for one reason or another to add helpful context.
</details>

I have lots more Block Editor code or custom WordPress PHP features I can share upon request,
but without further ado, in no particular order of importance.

## 1. My Personal Website
[Repo](https://github.com/jomurgel/jomurgel-learn) | [Live](https://jomurgel.com)

This is my website, which you're on now if you're reading this. As of two weeks ago, this website didn't exist.
Prior to then, I had a single-page site; before that, I had a WordPress site with a simple design that I had never used.

Why the change? It was all in how I work. I write in markdown mainly using [IA Writer](https://ia.net/writer), which is natural to me. The
markdown support of Google Docs or WordPress left much to be desired, and parsing one to the other even more so. I
wanted a site that I could easily create content and deploy without _needing_ to be on a desktop computer. I am also
an educator, so I want to set myself up for success with future projects or apps. While not impossible to
do with WordPress or other frameworks, I saw more flexibility in the way I work and my future goals with JavaScript,
React, and a framework like Next.js.

Things I think are important:
- This is a static site build using Next.js 14 using the new(ish) App Router + Typescript.
- All post content is md or mdx formatted and in the `content/blog` folder. That subfolder, for now,
delineates between the blog and what might be work or other content types in the future. This is how I write and add
content, commit, and deploy the static export using a GitHub Workflow. For example, you're reading "hidden" content in
a subdirectory in content that doesn't see the light of day with robots disabled and no external linking.
- This was built over a weekend, so there are quite a few "phase 2" `@todo` notes throughout, but this
gives you some insight into how I work. I plan on adding test coverage where applicable and a little more dynamic
functionality or parts of the site to become a little more engaged here instead of on other social media platforms like
Threads or Instagram.
- The `mdx-components.tsx` file supports some custom handling of markdown output.
- For bonus points, you can check out the [acorn.css](https://github.com/jomurgel/acorn.css) framework I also
built, and this site uses. A classless CSS framework. Except for a couple of required areas,
this website has no classes; this is by design.

## 2. Auto-documentation w/ Nextra
[Repo](https://github.com/jomurgel/auto-docs) | [Live (TBD)]()

This is a proof-of-concept documentation app using Next.js and Nextra, which is intended to
pull documentation from a `docs` directory or individual `md` or `mdx` files.

The metric here was *speed to documentation*. Rather than requiring devs to adhere to learning
something like Storybook and enforce it at scale, or require that devs update the documentation in a
separate repo, I opted to fallback to markdown, which all devs should already be familiar with because of
GitHub.

> Document as you code, and let "auto-docs" do the rest.

The `cli` directory is the big thing here, and it includes various commands, parsers,
configs, and utilities or services. The `runners` work here by defining
an individual file's input and output locations (`generate-template-single.js`) or
a directory of `md` files (`generate-template-directory.js`). More info about this in the README.

Every bit of the `cli` suite was bespoke and written to follow a specific convention of
writing docBlocks defined by the best standards of JS and PHP. This was effectively the
first (successful) pass at an auto-documentation suite. There are a lot of places I'd
make improvements, and I would be happy to discuss those if there's interest.

The [T◩DY — TBD]() repo's docs utilize this auto-docs workflow. That documentation is
automatically available on the Github Pages site. Link above.

## 3. T◩DY
[Repo](https://github.com/jomurgel/t.dy)

I built this app over the last couple of days. It serves to demonstrate my knowledge of:

- Meaningful React Code: Uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for data management and
Redux is for state management and has various complex components and hooks.
- Automated Testing using Jest and the [React Native Testing Library](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-testing-library).
- React Native

This app was already on my roadmap, but I've expedited it a bit and slimmed back the
feature set to accommodate a quick turnover.

## 4. WP Gutenberg Site Options

[Repo](https://github.com/jomurgel/wp-gutenberg-site-options)

This proof-of-concept WordPress plugin provides Gutenberg/Block Editor features to a
Site Options page via a bespoke React app with a custom WordPress hook and components.

<img src="/hidden/gutenberg-options-demo.png" alt="Screenshot of the Gutenberg Site Options Demo" />

<details open>
  <summary>Note:</summary>

  This is part of an in-progress blog series which hasn't posted yet.
</details>

Things I think are important:
- The `use-site-options` hook. This provides an output of the site settings object, loading and saving states, and a setter that makes a post request to the `/wp/v2/settings` endpoint, which updates at a debounce and asynchronously.
- The `site-options` component is the admin field output, and the `SnackbarList` output uses the `Notices` components. There is nothing super noteworthy here, but it utilizes Gutenberg elements.
The `notices` component handles displaying the "Settings Updates" text inside the `SnackbarList` component, providing user feedback that the POST request has been made successfully.
- In all component cases, I ensure there is at least _some_ README context.


## 5. Gutenberg Block Showcase Plugin
[Repo](https://github.com/jomurgel/gutenberg-block-showcase)

<details open>
  <summary>Note:</summary>

  There is only a small selection of Gutenberg/Block Editor features here. I have built, literally, hundreds of
  custom Block Editor blocks and features, but have little to show for it as most of it was proprietary. **However,
  I'm happy to build a bespoke block with some subset of interaction, features, or functionality for the
  Block Editor.**
</details>

This is intended to be primarily a catalog of work I've done in the WordPress Block Editor/Gutenberg space. I spent a day pulling out features I thought were interesting or felt proud of. I expect to contribute more to this repo in the future.

Things I think are important:
- The `hooks` directory contains a bunch of valuable hooks that I've written over the years, from monitoring the viewport width to engaging with post terms and inner blocks. Some may be more targeted
approaches to pre-existing core features or extend them, such as `use-taxonomy.`
- The `components` directory contains a few useful components. I'm particularly proud of the `post-search` component used in the "Demo Search" block.
- All of the components and features utilize PropType validation. At this point in history, I had yet to adopt TypeScript, but it was essential to do as much as we could in terms of validation. The concept of PropTypes
was something I brought to my last employer and implemented.
- All non-block work is accompanied by a README, which is especially useful regarding hooks, components, and other shared elements. Documentation is of the utmost importance to me.
- While my ideal approach with the Block Editor is trying to make the editor as close to a 1:1 experience with the frontend, if that's not a possibility, I aim to create as much of a WordPress-like experience
as I can, even if that means a few extra editor styles to make that happen. All to keep the barrier of engagement low.
The `blocks`, `filters`, `store`, and `slotfills` are the ones to examine in more depth. A breakdown of those is below.

### Slotfills
Custom Slotfill. I've created a custom GBSSidebarPanel slotfill, which exists in a custom Sidebar, below. This repo contains one slotfill of note.

### Revision
The revision slotfill provides a more robust revision panel for users who appreciate the more direct interaction of the revision panel offered to the Classic editor. It provides a snapshot of the last, up to ten, revisions, the user, timestamp, and user-readable time output. Each timestamp links to the revisions directly.

<img alt="Screenshot of Slotfill" data-align="center" src="/hidden/revision-slot.png" />

### Sidebar
I've added a custom sidebar (with my little JM logo) and a standard sidebar implementation. It contains a custom slot, `GBSSidebarPanel,` in the `src/components` directory. A custom slotfill uses it, adding a revisions feature, making this sidebar a little more expandable than standard slot areas.

![Custom Slotfill + Sidebar Panel](/hidden/sidebar-slot.png)

<details open>
  <summary>Note:</summary>

  This feature also exists right under the Post Publish panel, but I addded to the sidebar as filler, from a
user-experince perspective, it wouldn't make sense to move it into another panel like the Sidebar here.
</details>

### Store
This is a very basic implementation of a WordPress Redux-style store, working primarily to check for post lock status or provide a post revision lookup for the "Revision" slotfill above.

It is also used by the "Post Save Modal" feature, mentioned below.

### Filters
A few odds and ends features I really like.

#### Open Panels
A filter that keeps the Post Publish panel open by default on a post load. A client requested that, as they were getting lost, they needed help finding the sidebar icon in the top right. It uses the `preferences` and `editor` APIs to make that happen.

#### Pin Notifications
This one is particularly useful. It pins the notifications, warnings, notices, or errors to the top of the editor iframe. This is particularly useful when the post content is long, and saving may result in an error that would otherwise be pinned to the top out of the user's view.

<figure data-align="wide">
  <img src="/hidden/pinned-notice.png" alt="Pinned warning notice" />
  <figcaption>Demonstrating the mobile-sized window preview</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Preview Link
This was built before the updates in WordPress, adding the direct link for previewing a post in a new tab when the user had a preview button, resulting in in-editor mobile, table, or external link options. Users didn't find the in-editor views handy since many of the blocks weren't built (at the time) for mobile experiences the way core blocks are. I still find this feature useful.

It adds a `Preview` button that will directly open a new tab with a post preview. Next to it is a device icon that provides options for mobile or table preview, which opens new windows in general mobile and tablet sizes.

This uses the `src/components/post-preview-button` component.

<figure data-align="wide">
  <img alt="Preview Button" src="/hidden/preview-mobile.png" />
  <figcaption>Demonstrating the mobile-sized window preview</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Reset Editor Panels
This quick filter will auto-close all open panels and save the publish panel on post-load. It just keeps the editor tidy. It uses the `useWindowWidth` hook to avoid firing if the viewport width is smaller than where the panel wouldn't be visible.

#### Save Process Filter
The Save Process feature was added to improve the user's understanding of when a post was fully saved. While they didn't need to understand the difference between the REST and server-side POST save requests, this provided a little extra feedback. It pops up a modal showing the REST and Post Save status and then dismisses itself after saving so the user can be sure that everything was saved. Losing content was a real worry when many staff would write and edit posts directly in the Block Editor.

### Blocks
Custom Gutenberg/Block Editor Block features.

<details open>
  <summary>Note:</summary>

  These blocks have had their PHP or `render_callback` stripped for time along with a few other things, though nothing
  really important in these cases in terms of what could be done for a showcase demo.
</details>

#### Top and Bottom Blocks
A request was made to provide an interface for interacting with a post type from top to bottom without using the sidebar or many of the core features built into WordPress. Among those features was a "top" and "bottom" block, which would always live at the top and bottom of a post, be locked at those locations, and include several children defined by JSON configs (not included in this repo).

For the demo, the top block included the post title and a post-date block, and the bottom block included post-term-selector options for tags, categories, and SEO blocks.

<div data-gallery data-align="full">
  <figure>
    <img src="/hidden/top-bottom-open.png" alt="WordPress screenshot of the top and bottom block in use" />
  </figure>
  <figure>
    <img src="/hidden/top-bottom.png" alt="WordPress screenshot of the top and bottom block in use, bottom blocks open" />
  </figure>
</div>

These blocks were locked by default and could not be moved, and each block, if it makes sense, has a condensed "slim" version, which is lighter weight and makes fewer API requests than if they're open to improve editor load times on some of these features. This Post Term Selector or SEO Blocks, for example.

#### Post Term Selector
This block has multiple variations for `category` and `post_tag,` respectively, as shown above.

These blocks are inline versions of the standard post-term selector baked into Core Gutenberg and, in fact, utilize the core components to some extent.

![Category and Tag post term selector](/hidden/post-term-selector.png)

However, the `Post Tag` variation also provides an auto-tag generator from the post title or a comma-separated string. Which users found immensely helpful in improving the speed of tag creation.

![Bulk tag creator](/hidden/bulk-tag-creation.png)

#### SEO Block
This block provides a title and description field for SEO overrides. It also provides an auto-copy from the post title button, which will auto-fill the title field: a client-request. All are meant to resemble the old Google search results.

<div data-gallery data-align="full">
  <figure>
    <img src="/hidden/seo.png" alt="SEO Block" />

  </figure>
  <figure>
  <img src="/hidden/seo-sidebar.png" alt="SEO Sidebar" />
  </figure>
</div>

It also provides some additional canonical override and no-indexing options in the sidebar features.

#### Post Title
This block is intended to provide a default post title field at any point in the layout. Some people like to add images or other elements above the main content. This block functions nearly identically with some extra little sanization support. It also visually removes the core title element if the `gbs/post-title` block exists.

![Post Title Block](/hidden/post-title.png)

Also visible in use in the [Top Block](#top-and-bottom-blocks) above.

#### Tease
It's a simple inline block, but it has a `Collapsable Wrapper` element, a custom component that effectively hides some content from view that may not necessarily be pertinent to the workflow all the time. It also supports removing the block by clicking the "trash bin" icon instead of needing to use the Block Editor UI. This is a rave addition.

![Tease Block](/hidden/tease.png)

#### Demo Search
This is a block I built to showcase the Post Search suite of tools. It consists of a search form and a search modal from the `src/components/post-search.` The `SearchForm` component is the base feature, while the `SearchModal` takes advantage of the form and passes the response back to the parent.

The demo does nothing but search and is intended to show off the features of the search form, modal, results, and card components.
