  <summary>A Quick Note Before We Start:</summary>

  With the exception of T◩DY, which I built over the last couple of days, and my website which
  is a few weeks old, the rest has been compiled over the last five or so years of work which
  inherently means that some functionality or dependencies which were likely proprietary have been
  removed or lost and may prevent features from functioning. I've added notes throughout if
  there's a caveat to the code for one reason or the other to add helpful context.
</details>

I have lots more Block Editor code or custom WordPress PHP features I can share upon request,
but without further ado, in no particular order of importance.

## 1. My Personal Website
[Repo](https://github.com/jomurgel/jomurgel-learn) | [Live](https://jomurgel.com)

This is my personal website that you're on now, if you're reading this. As of two weeks ago this website didn't exist.
Prior to then I had a single page site; before that a WordPress site of a simplar design that I never used.

Why the change? It was all in how I work. I write in markdown mostly using [IA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) which is natural to me. The
markdown support if Google Docs or WordPress left alot to be desired, and parsing one to the other even more so. I
wanted a site that I could easily create content and deploy without _needing_ to be on a desktop computer. I am also
an educator so I wanted to eventually set myself up for success with future projects or apps. While not impossible to
do with WordPress or other frameworks, I saw more flexibility in the way I work and my future goals with JavaScript,
React, and a framework like Next.js.

Things I think are important:
- This is a static site build using Next.js 14 using the new(ish) App Router + Typescript.
- All post content is md or mdx formatted located in the `content/blog` folder. The subfolder for now
delineates between blog and what might be work or other content types in the future. This is the way
that I write and makes the process of adding content, committing, and having the static export deployed
using a Github Workflow. For example, you're reading "hidden" content in a subdirectory in content that don't see
the light of day with robots disabled and no external linking.
- This was built over a weekend so there are quite a few "phase 2" `@todo` notes throughout, but this
gives you some insight into how I work. I plan on adding test coverage where applicable and a little more dynamic
functionality or parts of the site to become a little more engaged here instead of on other social media platforms like
Threads or Instagram.
- The `mdx-components.tsx` file supports some custom handling of markdown output.
- For bonus points you can check out the [acorn.css](https://github.com/jomurgel/acorn.css) framework that I also
built and that this site uses. A classless CSS framework. With the exception of a couple of areas that required them,
there are no classes in use on this website; this is by design.

## 2. Auto-documentation w/ Nextra
[Repo](https://github.com/jomurgel/auto-docs) | [Live (TBD)]()

This is a proof of concept documentation app using Next.js and Nextra which is intended to
pull in documentation from a `docs` directory or individual `md` or `mdx` files.

The metric here was *speed to documentation*. Rather than requiring devs ahear to learning
something like Storybook and enforce it at scale, or require that devs update documentation in a
separate repo I opted to fallback to markdown which all devs should already be familiar with because of
GitHub.

> Document as you code, and let "auto-docs" do the rest.

The `cli` directory is the big thing here which includes various commands, parsers,
configs and util or services. The `runners` are what do the real work here by defining
the input and output locations of an individual file (`generate-template-single.js`) or
a directory of `md` files (`generate-template-directory.js`). More info about this
in the README.

Every bit of the `cli` suite was bespoke and written to follow a certain convention of
writing docBlocks defined by the best standards of JS and PHP. This was effectively the
first (successful) pass at an auto-documentation suite. There's a lot of places I'd
make improvements, and would happy to discuss those if there's interest.

The [T◩DY — TBD]() repo's docs utilizes this auto-docs workflow. That documentation is
automatically available on the Github Pages site. Link above.

## 3. T◩DY
[Repo](https://github.com/jomurgel/t-dy)

I built this app over the last couple of days. It serves to demonstrate my knowledge of:

- Meaningful React Code: Uses [Supabase]() for data management and Redux for state management
along with various complex components and hooks.
- Automated Testing using Jest and [] add testing library.
- React Native

This app was already on my personal roadmap. I've just expedited it a little bit, slimmed back
the feature-set a little bit to accomodate a quick turnover.

## 4. WP Gutenberg Site Options

[Repo](https://github.com/jomurgel/wp-gutenberg-site-options)

This is a proof-of-concept WordPress plugin that provides Gutenberg/Block Editor features to a Site
Options page via a bespoke React app with a custom WordPress hook and components.

<img src="/hidden/gutenberg-options-demo.png" alt="Screenshot of the Gutenberg Site Options Demo" />

<details open>
  <summary>Note:</summary>

  This is part of an in-progress blog series which hasn't posted yet.
</details>


Things I think are important:
- The `use-site-options` hook. This provides output of the site settings object,
loading and saving states, and a setter which makes a post request to the `/wp/v2/settings` endpoint
which updates at a debounce and asynchronously.
- The `site-options` component is the admin field outputs along with the `SnackbarList` output
using the `Notices` components. Nothing super special here, but utilizes Gutenberg elements.
- The `notices` component handles displaying the "Settings Updates" text inside the
`SnackbarList` component providing the user feedback that the POST request has been made successfully.
- In all component cases I make sure that there is at least _some_ README context.


## 5. Gutenberg Block Showcase Plugin
[Repo](https://github.com/jomurgel/gutenberg-block-showcase)

<details open>
  <summary>Note:</summary>

  There is only a small selection of Gutenberg/Block Editor features here. I have built, literally, hundreds of
  custom Block Editor blocks and features, but have little to show for it as most of it was proprietary. **However,
  I'm happy to build a bespoke block with some subset of interaction, features, or functionality for the
  Block Editor.**
</details>

This is intended to be mostly a catalog of work I've done in the WordPress Block Editor/Gutenberg
space. I spent a day pulling out features I thought were interesting or I felt in some way proud of. I expect to
contribute to this repo more going forward.

Things I think are important:
- The `hooks` directory contains a bunch of useful hooks that I've written over the years doing everything
from monitoring the viewport width to engaging with post terms and inner blocks. Some may be more targeted
approaches to some pre-existing core features, or extend them. `use-taxonomy` for example.
- The `components` directory contains a few useful components. I'm particularly proud of the `post-search`
component which is used in the "Demo Search" block.
- All of the components and features utilize PropType validation. At this point in history, I haden't yet adopted
TypeScript, but it was important to do as much as we could in terms of validation. The concept of PropTypes
was something I brought to my last employer and actually implemented.
- All of non-block work is accompanied by a README which is especially useful in terms of hooks or components
and other shared elements. Documentation is of the utmost important to me.
- While my ideal approach with the Block Editor is trying to make the editor as close to a 1:1 experience
with the frontend, if that's not a possibility I aim to create as much of a WordPress-like experience
as I can, even if that means a few extra editor styles to make that happen. All in an effort to
keeping the barrier of engagement low.
- The `blocks`, `filters`, `store`, and `slotfills` are the ones to look at in more depth. A breakdown
of those are below.

### Slotfills
Custom Slotfill. I've created a custom GBSSidebarPanel slotfill which exists in a custom Sidebar, below. This repo
contains ones slotfil of note.

### Revision
The revision slotfill provides a more robust revision panel for users that appreciated the more direct interaction of
the revision panel offered to the Classic editor. It provides snapshot of the last, up to ten, revision, the user,
timestamp, and user-readable time output. Each timestamp links to the revisions directly.

<img alt="Screenshot of Slotfill" data-align="center" src="/hidden/revision-slot.png" />

### Sidebar
I've added a custom sidebar (with my little JM logo). Standard sidebar implementation. It contains within it a custom
slot `GBSSidebarPanel` which exists in the `src/components` directory and is used by a custom slotfill adding revisions
feature making this sidebar a little more expandable than standard slot areas.

![Custom Slotfill + Sidebar Panel](/hidden/sidebar-slot.png)

NOTE: This feature also exists right under the Post Publish panel, but I addded to the sidebar as filler, from a
user-experince perspective, it wouldn't make sense to move it into another panel like the Sidebar here.

### Store
This is a very basic implementation of a WordPress Redux-style store working primarily as a way to check for post lock
status or providing post revision lookup for the "Revision" slotfill above.

It is also used by the "Post Save Modal" feature, mentioned below.

### Filters
A few odds and ends features I really like.

#### Open Panels
A filter which keeps the Post Publish panel open by default on a post load. A client request as they were getting lost
not being able to find the sidebar icon in the top right. Uses the `preferences` and `editor` APIs to make that happen.

#### Pin Notifications
This one is particularly useful. It pins the notifications warnings, notices, or errors to the top of the editor iframe.
Particularly useful when the post content is long and saving may result in an error that would otherwise be pinned to
the top out of view of the user.

<figure data-align="wide">
  <img src="/hidden/pinned-notice.png" alt="Pinned warning notice" />
  <figcaption>Demonstrating the mobile-sized window preview</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Preview Link
This was build prior to the updates in WordPress adding the direct link for previewing a post in a new tab, when the
user had a preview button which resulted in in-editor mobile, table, or external link options. Users didn't find the
in-editor views particularly useful since a lot of the blocks weren't built (at the time) for mobile experiences the way
core blocks. This feature, however, I still find this useful.

It adds a `Preview` button which will direcly open a new tab with a post preview. Next to it a device icon which provies
options for mobile or table preview which opens new windows at a general mobile and tablet size.

This uses the `src/components/post-preview-button` component.

<figure data-align="wide">
  <img src="Preview Button" src="/hidden/preview-mobile.png" />
  <figcaption>Demonstrating the mobile-sized window preview</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Reset Editor Panels
This is a quick filter which will auto-close all open panels, save the publish panel, on post load. Just keeps the editor
tidy. Uses the `useWindowWidth` hook to avoid firing if the viewport width is smaller than where the panel wouldn't
be visible.

#### Save Process Filter
The Save Process was feature was added as part of an effort of improving the user understanding of when a post was
fully saved. While they didn't need to understand the difference between the REST and sever-side POST save request,
this provided a little extra feedback popping up a modal showing the REST and Post Save status and then dismissing
itself after save so the user could be sure that everything was saved. Losing content was a real worry when a lot of
staff would write and edit posts directly in the Block Editor.

### Blocks
Custom Gutenberg/Block Editor Block features.

<details open>
  <summary>Note:</summary>

  These blocks have had their PHP or `render_callback` stripped for time along with a few other things, though nothing
  really important in these cases in terms of what could be done for a showcase demo.
</details>

#### Top and Bottom Blocks
A request was made to provide an interface for interacting with a post type from top to bottom without using the sidebar
or a lot of the core feature that are built into WordPress. Among those features was a "top" and "bottom" block which
would always live at the top and bottom of a post, locked at those locations, and include several children defined by JSON
configs (not included in this repo).

Here, for the demo, the top block included the post title block, a post-date block, and the bottom block included a
post-term-selector options for tags and categories and an SEO blocks.

<div data-gallery data-align="full">
  <figure>
    <img src="/hidden/top-bottom-open.png" alt="WordPress screenshot of the top and bottom block in use" />
  </figure>
  <figure>
    <img src="/hidden/top-bottom.png" alt="WordPress screenshot of the top and bottom block in use, bottom blocks open" />
  </figure>
</div>

These blocks were locked by default and could not be moved and each block, if it makes sense, has a condensed "slim" version
which is lighter weight and makes fewer API requests than if they're open to improve editor load times on some of these features.
You can see this example in the Post Term Selector or SEO Block below.

#### Post Term Selector
This is one block with multiple variations for `category` and `post_tag` respectively—shown above.

These blocks are inline versions of the standard post term selector baked into Core Gutenberg and in fact, utilize
the core components to some extent.

![Category and Tag post term selector](/hidden/post-term-selector.png)

However, the `Post Tag` variation also provides an auto-tag generator from the post title or from a comman-separated
string. Which users found emensely helpful in improving the speed of tag creation.

![Bulk tag creator](/hidden/bulk-tag-creation.png)

#### SEO Block
This block provides a title and description field for SEO overrides. It also provides an auto-copy from post title button
which will auto-fill the title field: a client-request. All meant to resemble the Google search results of old.

<div data-gallery data-align="full">
  <figure>
    <img src="/hidden/seo.png" alt="SEO Block" />
    <img src="/hidden/seo-open.png" alt="SEO Open" />
  </figure>
  <figure>
  <img src="/hidden/seo-sidebar.png" alt="SEO Sidebar" />
  </figure>
</div>

It also provides some additional canonical override and no-indexing options in the sidebar features.

#### Post Title
This block is intended to provide a default post title field, but at any point in the layout. Some people like to add
images or other elements above the main content. This block functions nearly identical with some extra little santization
support. It also removes the core title element visually if the `gbs/post-title` block exists.

![Post Title Block](/hidden/post-title.png)

Also visible in use in the [Top Block](#top-and-bottom-blocks) above.

#### Tease
A simple inline block, but it `Collapsable Wrapper` element, a custom component that effectively works to hide some content from
view that may not necessarily be pertindent to the workflow all of the time. Also supports removing the block by clicking
the "trash bin" icon vs needing to use the Block Editor UI. A rave addition.

![Tease Block](/hidden/tease.png)

#### Demo Search
This is a block I built to show off the Post Search suite of tools. This is a search form and a search modal, from
the `src/components/post-search`. The `SearchForm` component is the base feature, while the `SearchModal` takes advantage
of the form and passes the response back to the parent.

The demo does nothing but search, but is intended to show off the features of the serach form, modal, results, and card
components.
