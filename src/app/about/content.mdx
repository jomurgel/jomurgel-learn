I have over 11 years in web development, and have built a career that combines a strong technical base with strategic thinking. I started in design and illustration before moving into UX/UI and eventually frontend development. Today, I specialize in WordPress theme and plugin development, with particular focus on the Gutenberg Block Editor, and single-page application development. My skills include Next.js, React, and vanilla JavaScript, the standard set of frontend tech, and experience with Node/Express app development and API architecture.

I strongly believe websites should serve a clear purpose and drive real business results, not just exist because "everyone needs a website." This belief shapes how I approach projects from start to finish, allowing me to make better decisions about user experience, flow, and architecture that align with what organizations actually need. As the web continues to evolve, I focus on creating sites that work well for both human visitors and new AI technologies, ensuring they deliver genuine value.

Computers run on a set of rules. People are sponteous, messy, and irrational and they way they use or build the web is no different. These days, I focus on the the human element. People, not computers, are assets worth cultivating and helping grow into our next generation of engineers.

When I'm not coding, I pursue photography, create art, and build furniture in my workshop. These hands-on creative activities complement my digital work and reinforce my appreciation for craftsmanship in all its forms. This balance of digital and physical creation influences how I approach development, valuing both functionality and thoughtful design.
