## Music

[Kintsugi](https://open.spotify.com/album/6BK3muExDOuk0VnyMn9NVw?si=x-fq2btXSO-DxK0xZWIMLg) by Death Cab for Cutie always feels like an album I need when I need a chill vibe. My music otherwise ebbs and flows. I'm not particularly musical myself, so I like music based on how it makes me feel. I like a lot of individual songs, fewer full albums, and even fewer actual bands.

## Books
I prefer audiobooks, but have gotten into physical (hardcover) books recently. I'm currently reading through the [Jane Series](https://www.harpercollins.com/collections/books-series-the-lady-janies), because I'm a teenage girl. They're quite fun.

- <strike>My Lady Name</strike>
- <strike>My Plain Jane</strike>
- My Calamity Jane
- My Imaginary Mary
- My Contrary Mary
- My Salty Mary

I also quite liked Ready Player One and Ready Player Two by Ernest Cline.

## Movie
I love movies in general, but [Arrival](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543164/), starring Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner, directed by Denis Villeneuve, and an amazing score by the late Jóhann Jóhannsson.
